<h1>From update 1.9.1, Demo System is no more.</h1>
<p>Due to my poor coding of the game, such as using the same RNG for UI and gameplay aspects, it's impossible for me to fix the desync problem <a href="https://github.com/norbcodes/entities/issues/53">(#53)</a>. I deeply apologize.</p>
<p>This page explains how demos worked, how the .edemo format worked, and other stuff.<br>Table of contents:<br></p>

<h1>Demo System</h1>

<a id="1.1"></a>
<h2>What are demos?</h2>
<p>
A <b>demo</b> captures ingame gameplay like a normal video does, but not quite.<br>
A demo containts a sequence of <b>keypresses</b> that happened during the gameplay, and plays them back.<br>
This means that instead of sharing a huge video file, you can send this tiny demo file and other people<br>
can watch your gameplay natively in their own copy of entities2.<br><br>
In this document, you'll learn how it works in depth.
</p>

<a id="1.2"></a>
<h2>Possible Concerns</h2>
<p>
The main question here is:<br>
<b><i>Is there a possibility for desync?</i></b><br>
While it is possible, the .edemo format contains extra metadata for accurate playback. (How ironic.)<br><br>
<b><i>Will old demos work in newer versions and vice versa?</i></b><br>
Yes! But only if the .edemo formats match. While the game itself cannot convert .edemo formats,<br>
there will be a standalone program that will be able to convert between ALL .edemo formats (assuming<br>there even will be that many of them).

The header contains some useful metadata about the demo.<br>

<h2>Body</h2>
<p>
Rather than giving you a table, I will explain in text.<br>
The body of a demo, is essentially a sequence of bytes that are decoded by the game.<br><br>

Now, each move when written into the file is turned into an <b>int8</b> meaning the bytes are <b>signed</b>.<br>
Player moves have 4 bits from the right treated as the choice, and the resulting byte is <i>ALWAYS >=0</i>.<br>
Enemy moves work the same way, except they are <i>ALWAYS <0</i>.<br>
(In the code, if it's an enemy move, it's basically negated with the unary - operator.)<br><br>

For example, if the player picks move 2, it is stored as 2, however when the enemy picks the move 2<br>
it is stores as -2.<br><br>

Mentioned earlier is the unsigned 32 bit integer stating how many moves were recorded,<br>
so the game will read this many bytes and ignore the rest.
